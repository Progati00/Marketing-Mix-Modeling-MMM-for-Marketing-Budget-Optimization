# üìä Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) for Marketing Budget Optimization

This project implements **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** using Python to evaluate the impact of various marketing channels on revenue. It enables data-driven budget allocation decisions, ROI measurement, and "What-If" scenario simulations for better marketing efficiency and strategic planning.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a regression-based technique that helps businesses quantify the impact of marketing activities on performance metrics such as revenue. This project builds a baseline MMM using Linear Regression and offers simulation capabilities to optimize marketing budgets.

## üß† Objectives

- Understand how different marketing channels impact revenue
- Calculate marketing Return on Investment (ROI)
- Simulate budget changes (e.g., "What if we increase YouTube ads by 20%?")
- Build an API for revenue prediction based on marketing input data

---

## üîç Data Overview

- Multi-region ecommerce dataset with 132,759 rows and 50 columns
- Includes time series data across paid channels (Google, Meta, TikTok), engagement signals (clicks, impressions), and purchase data

---

## üßº Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Dropped channels with excessive missing data: TikTok, Google Video, Google Display, Meta Other
- Filled missing values in key spend and click columns with `0`
- Removed non-critical metadata columns such as verticals and sub-verticals
- Converted `DATE_DAY` to datetime format

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Engineering

### Revenue Calculation
```

revenue = ALL\_PURCHASES\_ORIGINAL\_PRICE - ALL\_PURCHASES\_GROSS\_DISCOUNT

```

### Total Marketing Spend
```

total\_spend = sum of all relevant ad spend columns

```

### ROI Calculation
```

roi = revenue / (total\_spend + 1)

```

### Time Features Extracted
- `year`
- `month`
- `week`
- `day_of_week`

## üîç Feature Importance (Coefficients)

| Feature                    | Coefficient      |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| `year`                     | +19,603.65       |
| `month`                    | +2,600.52        |
| `GOOGLE_PAID_SEARCH_SPEND`| +86.76           |
| `EMAIL_CLICKS`             | +80.48           |

## üîÑ ROI Analysis

- ROI is calculated to evaluate marketing efficiency:
```

roi = revenue / (total\_spend + 1)

```
- Allows clear comparison of which channels drive the most revenue per unit spend

---

## üí° What-If Simulation

### Scenario: Increase Google Paid Search Spend by 30%
```

scenario = X\_test.copy()
scenario\['GOOGLE\_PAID\_SEARCH\_SPEND'] \*= 1.3

```

### Result
```

Simulated change in revenue: +4.60%

````

You can run similar simulations to answer:
- What if we increase YouTube ads by 20%?
- What happens if we cut back on PMax or Meta Facebook spend?
- Which channels provide the best incremental lift?

## üéØ Goal: Marketing Budget Optimization

- Simulate budget reallocations
- Identify top-performing channels
- Make data-backed investment decisions
